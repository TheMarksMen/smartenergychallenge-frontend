Project created for ELECTENG/COMPSYS 209 at the University of Auckland. This website displays the peak voltage, RMS current and average power measured by the smart energy monitor we designed.
This is our solution to the 'Smart Energy Challenge' which is about implementing a web-based data-logging system to store and display  the  data  from  the  smart  energy  monitor.


More information about the course can be found [here](https://uoa-ece209.github.io/).
